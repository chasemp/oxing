# Ox Security Script vs UI Results - Current Status Report

**Generated:** September 22, 2025  
**Analysis Date:** Current analysis of script functionality vs UI exported data

## Executive Summary

The analysis reveals significant discrepancies between the current fetching scripts and the UI-exported CSV data. The scripts are failing to connect to the Ox Security API due to DNS resolution issues, while the UI successfully exports comprehensive security findings data.

## Current Script Status

### 1. `fetch_findings.py` (GraphQL-based script)
- **Status:** ✅ **WORKING** - Fixed API URL configuration
- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.cloud.ox.security/api/apollo-gateway`
- **Last Successful Run:** September 23, 2025
- **Findings:** Successfully fetching 10 security issues (8 Secret, 1 Infrastructure, 1 Other)

### 2. `fetch_sca_findings.py` (REST API-based script)
- **Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - API URL fixed but authentication failing
- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.cloud.ox.security/api/apollo-gateway`
- **Error:** 401 Authentication failed (REST API may not be available)
- **Last Successful Run:** N/A (GraphQL endpoint is working instead)

## UI Exported Data Analysis

### CSV Files Available:
1. **`code_security_issues.csv`** - Open Source Security findings (18 records)
2. **`issues_scanId-c17e213c-44c3-412e-b3a6-9361543c34e0_hash-80b6068c.csv`** - Comprehensive findings (606+ records)

### Data Categories Found in UI Export:

#### 1. Open Source Security (SCA) - 18 findings
- **Severity Distribution:**
  - Low: 8 findings
  - Info: 10 findings
- **Applications:**
  - Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-sast
  - Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-container  
  - Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-sca
- **Vulnerability Types:**
  - Base image vulnerabilities (golang, ubuntu, node, python, nginx, debian)
  - Java dependencies (spring-boot-starter-web, junit, commons-lang3, jackson-databind)
  - JavaScript dependencies (handlebars, express)
  - Python dependencies (requests)

#### 2. Infrastructure as Code - 4 findings
- **Severity:** High (4 findings)
- **Issues:** Privilege escalation disabled in K8s deployments
- **Applications:** Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-secrets

#### 3. Secret/PII Scan - 12 findings
- **Severity Distribution:**
  - High: 2 findings (Mailchimp API Key, JWT tokens)
  - Medium: 10 findings (RSA keys, AWS credentials, passwords, tokens)
- **Applications:** Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-secrets

#### 4. Git Posture - 6 findings
- **Severity:** High (6 findings)
- **Issue:** Too many organization owners
- **Application:** *GitHub-Settings (Life360-Sandbox)

#### 5. Code Security (SAST) - 566+ findings
- **Severity:** Medium (566+ findings)
- **Vulnerability Types:**
  - Missing HttpOnly/Secure cookie flags
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Prototype Pollution
  - Remote Property Injection
  - SQL Injection
  - Path Traversal
  - Command Injection
  - And many more...
- **Applications:** Life360-Sandbox/ox-testing-sast

## Key Discrepancies Identified

### 1. **API Connectivity Issues**
- **Problem:** Scripts cannot resolve `api.ox.security` domain
- **Impact:** Complete failure to fetch any data via API
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Incorrect API endpoint URL
  - Network/DNS configuration issues
  - API endpoint may have changed

### 2. **Data Structure Mismatch**
- **Scripts Expect:** GraphQL/REST API responses with specific field names
- **UI Provides:** CSV format with different field structure
- **Field Mapping Issues:**
  - Scripts look for: `issueId`, `severity`, `scaVulnerabilities`
  - UI provides: `Severity`, `Category`, `Issue Name`, `Application`

### 3. **Coverage Gaps**
- **Scripts Target:** SCA vulnerabilities primarily
- **UI Exports:** Comprehensive data including SAST, Secrets, Infrastructure, Git Posture
- **Missing Data Types in Scripts:**
  - SAST findings (566+ records)
  - Secret/PII findings (12 records)
  - Infrastructure as Code (4 records)
  - Git Posture (6 records)

### 4. **Severity Mapping**
- **Scripts Use:** `oxSeverity` field
- **UI Uses:** `Severity` field with values: High, Medium, Low, Info
- **Mapping Required:** Need to align severity field names and values

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix API Connectivity**
   - Verify correct Ox Security API endpoint
   - Check network connectivity and DNS resolution
   - Test with different API base URLs if available

2. **Update Script to Match UI Data Structure**
   - Modify field mappings to match CSV structure
   - Add support for all finding types (SAST, Secrets, Infrastructure, Git Posture)
   - Implement proper severity mapping

3. **Expand Coverage**
   - Update `fetch_findings.py` to handle all security finding types
   - Add CSV export functionality to match UI format
   - Implement comprehensive filtering by category/type

### Medium Priority Actions

4. **Data Validation**
   - Add validation to ensure script output matches UI data
   - Implement comparison tools to verify data consistency
   - Add logging for data discrepancies

5. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error handling for API connectivity issues
   - Add fallback mechanisms for partial data retrieval
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Long-term Improvements

6. **Unified Data Model**
   - Create a common data model that works for both API and UI exports
   - Implement data transformation layer
   - Add support for multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)

7. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Add monitoring for script execution success/failure
   - Implement alerts for data discrepancies
   - Add performance metrics and reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate API Endpoint:** Contact Ox Security support to verify correct API endpoints
2. **Test Connectivity:** Try alternative API URLs or check network configuration
3. **Update Scripts:** Modify scripts to handle the comprehensive data structure from UI exports
4. **Validate Results:** Once scripts are working, compare output with UI data to ensure consistency

## Conclusion

The current scripts are not functional due to API connectivity issues and are not aligned with the comprehensive data structure available through the UI. The UI successfully exports 600+ security findings across multiple categories, while the scripts fail to retrieve any data. Immediate action is required to fix connectivity and align the script functionality with the UI capabilities.

**Note:** This analysis is based on the current state of the scripts and the exported CSV data from September 22, 2025. The scripts may have been working previously, but current logs show consistent failures.
